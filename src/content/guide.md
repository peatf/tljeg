TIMELINE JUMPING IS THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A FERTILE ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOUR DESIRES MUST THRIVE

Embodiment Guide
Timeline Jumping is taking on the identity of your desired self. Allowing more and more of your chosen self to exist in your body right now without a dependence on physical reality changing first. Reality is reflecting you, it cannot reflect back to you something you are not.
Reality absorbs the frequencies of who you are being and amplifies them back to you like a multidimensional radio. When your identity is a match to the identity of the self living your ideal reality, you become an environment that allows that reality to grow and thrive.
The embodiment of your chosen self is a daily choice. It is something that happens gradually and continuously. While the act of embodiment or timeline jumping is instantaneous, it does take time to reflect in physical reality.
However the time it takes to experience the timeline jump in the physical is a reflection of the commitment to “holding the shape” of the desired self.

Timeline Jumping Continued
Timeline Jumping can be simply put as BEING another version of yourself in the now. Choosing to be the desired self is not about force. If you feel like you are forcing or pushing hard you are attempting to embody an energy you aren’t ready to hold. Be kind to yourself you don’t need to push through.
My recommendation would be to Timeline Jump to a version of yourself that feels more accessible. This process is about becoming the energetic environment where your dream reality can thrive with greater and greater depth. As soon as you choose to “BE” you begin to call that timeline to you.
If you choose old self’s patterns every so often after a jump, that is okay. Aim for staying your chosen self at least half the time you are conscious.

Safety
The current self will not allow the next version of you to take up more space if it feels that is an unsafe decision. You need consent from yourself.
Do not bulldoze over the needs of the current self. If you are embodying a desired self to forcibly escape your reality you are attempting to embody from fear and lack. So the majority of your will be aimed in the direction of fear and lack, not from desire and you will not experience desirable results from that space. Allow yourself to tap into the sensation of safety before beginning your embodiment practice. (Can be as simple as locking your door before this practice or simply just letting yourself know that right now you are safe). Address resistance or blatant suspicion towards the chosen self.
What does the current self need to feel safe leaving your reality in the hands of the desired self. Evidence? examples? A generous time period? Etc. .
Ask yourself what is needed to feel safe. And give that to yourself.

Choosing your Character
If it feels supportive to you, get clear on who you are intending to become. Clarity doesn’t mean specificity here, clarity is awareness of your preferences. The version of yourself you’re embodying already exists and is a force pulling you to it so when you suspend attachment to who you are being now you automatically move in that direction. Many people do a timeline jump without a specific aim and that feels totally open and fun for them. However if you want to know more about where you are headed here are some prompts to assist in creating clarity. (Writing down the answers to these questions can be helpful to some)
	•	Who are you envious of? Envy is an emotional notification that some aspect of a person is desirable to you and attainable.
	•	Who are your heroes? In real life, in books, in animes etc. No matter how distant they seem from you. Why?
	•	What about your loved ones, do you enjoy? What is a thread connecting them all?
	•	Imagine looking in a mirror but the reflection is the “ideal” you, what do they look like? What expression is on their face?
A great way for you to understand your chosen/ideal/desired self is this quote by Michelangelo “The sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work. It is already there, I just have to chisel away the superfluous material. ”

Choosing your Character Continued
	•	Imagine meeting the ideal stranger, your dream companion, your absolute soulmate (not just romantically), what are they wearing? What do they smell like? What does their room look like? This dream companion, ask them what they believe about themselves. Ask them what four words they would use to describe themselves. What are their perspectives on life?
Now what do you like about them? Why are they so special to you?
These prompts are to get the ball rolling, be loose with them. You don’t need to take creating the clarity super seriously because this process of clarifying happens forever, there’s always more of you to step into.
Next notice where you are already experiencing those traits, energies, feelings, perspectives right now in your reality. Find the intersection between who you are being now and who you want to carry into your future.

Calibration
After you have spent time identifying this desired self and have found your common traits (I recommend actually writing down your commonalities) spend time observing these traits. Bask in the things about you that remind you of the desired self. Celebrate the ways that you have already become who you incarnated to be. Bringing awareness to the overlap between you and the desired self is extremely powerful. You have started to calibrate yourself to your desired timeline when you do this. It becomes mundane to be this person and is less shocking to the nervous system, opening the door wide to your desired timeline.

The Void
You have activated your desired timeline congrats!Now to begin to step onto this timeline you have created you must enter the void. The void is infinite nothing, darkness. In the void is where all potentials are accessible. Vibrationally the void feels like neutrality. The void is able to hold infinite potential because of the lack of light. When a potential is brought to light it begins to become solid in reality, and in darkness “reality” dissolves. The void holds the realities without casting judgments on them, in the void no realities are better than another, they have no meaning, no names no labels. To reach the void vibrationally you must allow yourself to move towards neutrality. Release all judgments about your current reality positive and negative.
You’ll want to allow yourself to perceive your reality as something that is just happening. Before releasing those judgments you must be honest about what they are, and how they are creating your current experience. A simple question to ask to do that is “who I have been being and what has that created in my reality?”

The Void Continued
In the void there is only the present, only awareness, beliefs about past or future selves cannot exist solidly in the void. Now the void is not a permanent destination, it is the lift off point. Because of the calibration you did earlier and the magnetic pull of your desired reality, you are already aimed in the direction of your desired reality and will move in that direction. Imagine that your frequency is like a vehicle at the top of a hill and the void puts that vehicle in neutral. You have aimed your “vehicle” in your desired direction and in neutral you automatically move down that hill.
At this point you will experience a change in emotion, and/or perspective as an indicator of arrival onto the new timeline. Hang out in this sensation as long as you want. You may be inspired to do something different in the next few hours or days. Do it, try it out. But you do not NEED to do anything different so no need to take new actions out of pressure, let the change happen and if an action is necessary you’ll feel the need to do it even if it doesn’t make sense.
It is done, you are them.

Your Chosen Self
Once you embody the desired self it becomes easier and easier to step into that self when you feel as though you have veered off. The chosen self does not fight the old self. If you feel like your old self is fighting the existence of who you desire to be, take a break, do not push through, let it go and try again tomorrow. Let your chosen self exist without force.
Nothing disconnects you from the desired self faster than expectations created from fear. If you step into the new self and are demanding immediate mind-blowing results from your reality, check in with the identity you are holding. Miraculous results are possible 100% but demanding them out of desperation is out of alignment with the chosen self. The chosen self is experiencing its desired reality. It isn’t looking for it. Be concerned with who you are being not trying to figure out how reality is going to reflect that identity back to you. Absorbing and transmitting back your frequency is reality’s singular job, your role is choosing your desired identity consistently.

Frequently Asked Questions
When should I do a Timeline Jump?You can trust your judgment & do the jumps whenever you feel called to. The only times I would not recommend doing a timeline jump is if you are feeling like you’re trying to escape your reality or avoid something. Those are times I’d recommend not trying to “move forward” because that tends to result in an energetic struggling-in-quicksand effect.
Can I jump too far?Yes, the way you’ll know is if an identity feels too difficult to hold. If it feels like you have to try to convince yourself you are that version of yourself that’s usually a sign that you’ve attempted to jump too far. There’s nothing that needs to be done if you’ve jumped further than you have the capacity for, the identity simply won’t hold. This tends to be the result of jumps taken to escape the reality one’s in.
Did I do it right?You can’t “mess it up” take this lightly, have fun, make it your own! The closest thing you can do to doing it wrong is trying Timeline Jumping while rejecting or attempting to avoid your current timeline. And even then you can always start over when you’re ready.
Can I jump to the wrong timeline?No, again you can’t mess it up. When you’re Timeline Jumping your focus is aimed at your desired timeline/self so that’s the only direction you move towards. What can happen however, is reality playing back your previous timeline because physical reality has a time delay. And since you’re no longer that previous version of yourself it’s an opportunity to choose to remain your chosen self even when something in reality that doesn’t match that. Hold the pose of your chosen self/timeline and reality must render based off of that.

Your Chosen Self Continued
The chosen self will not feel vastly different than the old self because it is still you. Believing that you need to completely overhaul who you are in some dramatic way tends to be a form of avoidance.
This process is not here to “fix” you, it is a process of embracing YOU just on a preferred timeline. Jumping timelines requires acceptance of your current timeline with love. You cannot jump timelines while energetically being at war with the one you are on because that attaches you to it. The “new” self is you but it responds a little bit differently than the previous version. It does not dominate without permission.
I recommend practicing this as often as you feel called until it feels natural. And even then keep practicing if it excites you.
This guide is a text based guide that is designed to be paired with the Timeline Jumping Audio. If you have another embodiment practice that involves connecting to various parts of yourself in the body this guide will pair well with that too. Embodiment is not the result of learning more it is the result of being, being with all of the self including the body. The Timeline Jumping Audio collapses all of what is written here into a 20 minute experience using visualization, breath, and awareness. The audio isn’t necessary but it absolutely helps this process to unfold with added ease.
