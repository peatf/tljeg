Finalized Project Plan: The Digital Artifact PWA
I. Executive Overview
This project creates a minimal, tactile Progressive Web App (PWA) that serves as an embodied companion to your guide. It is built on principles of privacy, offline functionality, and somatic interaction.
	•	The app is self-contained: no servers, no data collection, no internet requirement.
	•	It’s designed to help users not just read the guide, but practice it somatically and interactively.
The app offers two curated entry modes:
	•	Text-Only Version: A calm, read-only presentation of the 12 pages (your original guide).
	•	Digital Artifact: The full interactive experience — gestures, somatic prompts, offline ML enhancements, and tactility.
This binary choice replaces modular toggles; the artifact mode simply is the embodied version.

II. The Digital Artifact: Scene-by-Scene Flow
The artifact consists of 7 core scenes presented as a connected flow, navigable from the Home Flow Map.
1. Home: The Flow Map
	•	Minimalist diagram of the 7 scenes with the VOID at center.
	•	Subtle line animation shows the current position relative to the VOID.

2. Safety: Somatic Check-In
Purpose: To ensure the user feels safe to proceed, and to normalize pausing if not.
Flow:
	1	Environment setters (optional chips: “Do Not Disturb,” “Blanket,” “Closed door”). - Intro text - you will only allow with ease shifts in transformations into your reality that you feel safe receiving. It's most useful to proceed with this process from a baseline level of internal safety. 
	2	30-sec somatic scan with breath and posture cues.
	3	Consent Check: “Is it useful to proceed right now?” with 3 paths:
	◦	Proceed → continue flow.
	◦	Not yet → free-text reflection (“What is needed?”) + optional action chip.
	◦	A part says no → short dialogue to name/acknowledge the part.
Offline ML: User text (e.g., “tired, anxious”) is lightly parsed to suggest 1–2 needs (“rest,” “warmth”). Always optional.

3. Clarity: Chosen Self & Overlap
Purpose: To extract desired traits and ground them somatically.
Flow:
	1	Trait Extraction — prompts from guide (heroes, envy, admiration).
	2	Somatic Rehearsal (45s): choose one trait → guided posture + breath cues.
	3	Overlap Lens: identify where this trait already exists in their life today.
Offline ML (Two-Layer):
	•	Cold start: analyzes free text to propose trait chips (decisive, generous, spacious) even without prior data.
	•	Personalized: recalls user’s past traits and overlaps for continuity.

4. Calibration: Normalization
Purpose: To make the chosen identity feel ordinary and livable.
Flow (corrected from your note):
	1	Evidence Shelf: record one proof of chosen trait in daily life.
	2	Normalization Rehearsal (60s): user picks mundane context (email, commute, dishes) → guided micro-act as chosen self, with pendulation prompts.
	3	Friction Removal: pick one friction to reduce for tomorrow.
Offline ML (Two-Layer):
	•	Cold start: offers pre-seeded contexts & frictions (chips labeled (seed)).
	•	Personalized: surfaces past user contexts, proofs, and friction patterns (labeled (from you)).

5. VOID: The Hinge
Purpose: Release identity → embody neutrality.
Flow:
	1	Pre-Void De-labeling (30s): list 2–3 self-labels or judgments.
	2	Neutral Hold (2 min): triggered by two-finger tap; screen dims, rotating anchor words with light sensory cues appear.
	3	Post-Void Reflection: “What shifted without effort?”
Offline ML: Input like “I’m failing” is re-framed into neutral language (“There is a list of tasks, there is tightness in chest”).

6. Runtime: Operate from Chosen Self
Purpose: Translate identity into concrete action.
Flow:
	1	Operating Spec (24h): define chosen self-label, principle, 2 micro-acts, and 1 friction to remove.
	2	Quick Log: record actions + context, appended to a clean “Release Notes” timeline.
Offline ML (Two-Layer):
	•	Cold start: suggests micro-acts & frictions from seed corpus.
	•	Personalized: recalls user’s own past successful acts in similar contexts.

7. Resets / FAQ
Purpose: Normalize rest, regression, and cyclic progress.
Flow: 3 expandable FAQ-style options:
	•	Halve the distance
	•	Rest & re-enter via VOID
	•	Stay with overlap
Offline ML: If user text elsewhere includes strain words (“stuck,” “forcing”), “Halve the distance” is subtly highlighted next time.

III. Audio Integration
	•	The 20-minute guided track is not bundled.
	•	Instead: “Import Audio” slot lets users load any local MP3 (including the purchased track from your site). Cached offline after first import.
	•	Optional 20s support clips can also be cached.

IV. Technical & Architectural Specification
	•	Platform: PWA, installable to home screen.
	•	Offline First: Entire app, assets, and ML bundled and cached with Service Worker.
	•	Data: Stored locally (IndexedDB). User can “Reveal Data” as plaintext.
	•	ML: Transformers.js running quantized MiniLM-class models in a Web Worker. Uses pre-bundled seed corpus + live personalization.
	•	Gestures & Tactility: primary gesture per scene, subtle haptics or tones.
	•	Animations: 150–200ms, respect prefers-reduced-motion.

V. Visual & Copy Guidelines
	•	Colors: Bone, ink, slate palette.
	•	Typography: Grotesk headings + humanist serif body.
	•	Tone: Concise, invitational, verb-driven.
Examples:
	•	Safety: “Is it kind to proceed? If not—what is needed now?”
	•	VOID: “Not role. Not goal. Not story. Only noticing.”
	•	Runtime: “Choose → Act → Note → Normalize.”

✅ This corrected plan now:
	•	Fixes missing ML enhancement in Clarity (cold start trait extraction).
	•	Clarifies Calibration flow (your critique).
	•	Aligns with your decision for binary modes only (no toggles/packs).
	•	Clarifies audio handling (import, not bundled).
	•	Reinforces the two-layer ML (seed → personal) across Clarity, Calibration, Runtime.
