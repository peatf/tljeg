Artifact Map (Main Flow)
This map is the rhythm you’ll move through. Each step stacks on the last, and you can always drop back into VOID whenever you need a reset. You’ll start with Safety, anchoring yourself. Then move through Clarity, Calibration, VOID, and finally Implementation. Think less, rigid staircase, and more flow that matches how identity actually shifts. Safety first. Then clarity. Then real-world proof. Then dissolving resistance. And then the part where inspiration shows you what to do next. 
Safety
Change only roots when your system feels safe enough to let it land. If you try to push transformation from a body still vibrating with stress, it’s like planting seeds in pebbles, nothing takes. This stage is where you check your environment, name what you need, and give yourself permission to open. You’re telling your subconscious: we’re safe here. That single signal makes everything else easier. Or it could be a moment to tell yourself “hey I'm going to come back to this at a better time”.
Clarity
Clarity points your compass. Without it, your mind runs on yesterday’s autopilot. IMPORTANT: Manufacturing an identity is not what you are doing here. You are listening for what wants to emerge from you, reveal itself to you from your realities mirror. Sometimes it comes through admiration. Sometimes through tension, even jealousy. Both are signals. Here you name the trait or identity you’re leaning into now. Once it’s spoken, your energy reorients. You’re telling yourself: this is the version of me stepping forward next.
Calibration
Clarity without evidence is fragile. Calibration is how you ground it into everyday life. Rather than using dramatic grand gestures, you calibrate to new ways of being through tiny signals: the way you answer an email, how you move in your kitchen, the choices you make mid-commute. Your subconscious trusts repetition in the ordinary, that's how we create inertia. Recognize the small ways your new reality lets itself in, creating fresh inertia.  Every time you spot or create proof, you’re stacking it on a shelf of evidence: this is already me. Over time, that shelf becomes your new normal.
VOID
VOID is a shower. VOID is the dissolve.  Labels melt here, good or bad, success or failure, they soften until they disappear. Neutrality creates breathing room. Your being relaxes, no longer defending or rejecting a label. And in that emptiness, possibility pulls you forward. VOID is powerful because when you let go, space opens. And because desire is magnetic space naturally calls in the new identity you’ve been clarifying and calibrating.

Implementation (formerly Runtime)
This is where your clarified, calibrated self moves into the world. But the ~secret ~is, you don’t have to plan it all out. Desire has gravity. When you step out of VOID, it tugs you toward the right choices, conversations, and micro-acts that belong to this new version of you. Here you’ll name your day, choose a guiding principle, pick a couple of tiny actions, and clear one friction. If nothing arrives right away, leave space. Inspiration tends to sneak in once you stop forcing it.
Resets
Some days you’ll drift. That’s part of the rhythm. Resets don’t erase progress, they re-align you with what’s alive now. If something feels too far, shrink the step. If your system feels heavy, drop into VOID. If you’re unsure, hold onto one small piece of proof and let it carry you forward. Resets keep the whole process human. They’re how you stay in relationship with your becoming without pressure
FAQ
The FAQ is your reassurance file. When doubts pop up, this is where you can flip back and remember why this works, what to expect, and how to handle common bumps. You won’t need it every time, but when your mind gets noisy, it’s here to remind you of the bigger picture.
Storage
Storage is the mirror of your becoming. Every piece of evidence, principle, and action you save here turns into a library of you. When you revisit it, you’ll see patterns: traits that keep circling back, shifts that spark the biggest changes, proof that your identity is evolving over time. It’s how you build trust with yourself. The record shows: you’re moving. You’re becoming. You’re already in it.
